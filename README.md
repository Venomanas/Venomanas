  # Hey, I'm **Anas** 👋

### 🌱 About Me
- I like solving **real** problems — broken UI, slow apps, messy APIs, stuff that actually annoys people.  
- I build projects that **I personally wish existed**.  
- I prefer clean code, clean UI, and clean vibes.  
- Self-learning my way up as a web dev from a small corner of Navi Mumbai.

## ⚡ What I Work With
I use whatever gets the job done **without drama**:

### **Frontend**
- Next.js  
- React  
- TypeScript  
- TailwindCSS  
- A lot of experimenting & breaking things  

### **Backend**
- Node.js  
- Express  
- MongoDB  
- REST APIs  
- Auth stuff (JWT, Clerk, etc.)

### **Tools**
- Git (sometimes too many commits)  
- Vercel  
- Postman  
- VS Code (with way too many extensions)

## 🚀 What I’m Building / Fixing
I focus on **useful** things, not “Todo App #26”.

### 🔹 ConvertSign  
A fast tool to resize, convert and clean documents/images.  
Built because all online tools were either slow, paywalled, or ugly.

### 🔹 Anas-Pexels  
A clean, minimal photo explorer made with Next.js + Tailwind.  
Inspired by Pexels but lighter and distraction-free.

### 🔹 Python Compiler (web-based)  
A simple browser compiler that just… works.

More projects coming → probably tools that fix small annoying problems.

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Make smoother, Google-like UI interactions  
- Finish a proper **SaaS tool** (image or file-based)  
- Get better at debugging weird errors that appear at 2 AM  
- Build stuff consistently instead of 300 ideas stuck in notes
